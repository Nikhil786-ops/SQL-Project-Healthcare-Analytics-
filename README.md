# Hospital Data Analysis SQL Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a hospital dataset using SQL to derive insights on patient demographics, medical expenses, and operational efficiency. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for hospital management using PostgreSQL queries.

## Dataset
The dataset (`Hosp_data`) contains hospital records with columns like `Hospital_Name`, `City`, `Department`, `Doctors_Count`, `Patients_Count`, `Admission_Date`, `Discharge_Date`, and `Medical_Expenses`.

## Key Queries
1. **Total Patient Count**: Calculate total patients across all hospitals.
2. **Average Doctors per Hospital**: Assess staffing levels.
3. **Top 3 Departments**: Identify departments with the highest patient volumes.
4. ... (list all 10 queries)

## Insights
- Cardiology and General Medicine are the busiest departments, requiring more resources.
- Mumbai has the highest patient volume, indicating a need for expanded facilities.
- Neurology has the longest patient stays, suggesting complex treatments.

## Tools Used
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **SQL Editor**: pgAdmin
- **Visualization**: Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) or Power BI (optional)

## Files
- `hospital_data_analysis.sql`: SQL queries
- `sample_data.csv`: Sample dataset
- `visualizations/`: Charts and screenshots

## How to Run
1. Import the dataset into PostgreSQL.
2. Run the queries in `hospital_data_analysis.sql` using pgAdmin or DBeaver.
3. View results and visualizations for insights.
